# Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning & NLP
I’m excited to share my latest project on Sentiment Analysis of Tweets — a powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that combines text mining, data visualization, and machine learning models to classify tweets as positive or negative!

# Objective:
Detect and classify tweets containing hate speech (racist or sexist content) vs. neutral tweets using machine learning.
We focused on building a robust pipeline that covers:
Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
Feature engineering (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)
Training classification models
Data exploration & visualization

# Key Steps:
Preprocessed raw tweet text to clean noise (punctuation, special characters, numbers, irrelevant terms)
Extracted features using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
Built models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) and evaluated using F1-score
Visualized insights: common words, hashtag trends, sentiment distribution

# Outcome:
The models accurately classify sentiment, helping identify harmful or offensive tweets at scale.
Gained hands-on experience with NLP workflows, machine learning model building, and data storytelling.
